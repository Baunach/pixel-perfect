			<H1>[001] Real-Time Strategy</H1>
			<H3>April 2023 - Baunach<H3>
			<H2>The Building Blocks of a Bygone Genre</H2>
			<p>Whether or not you've played a real-time strategy game you're probably familiar with the various mechanics that define it: unit/production management on a micro and macro level, base building, and tactical combat - all together in real time. Though the earliest titles of the real-time strategy genre were developed during a predominantly offline era of PC gaming, as the focus of developers shifted from single-player to multiplayer the genre would steadily refine into a more complex and daunting form of it's prior self. This isn't inherently negative; while some titles were able to cultivate a large playerbase some developers would tweak basic components of the real-time strategy genre into their own distinctive genres [e.g. simulation, tower defense, MOBA, ARPG, etc].
